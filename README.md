Beginner’s Guide For Huobi
The CryptoGrinders Team has taken to using Huobi as one of their main cryptocurrency exchanges. If you’re curious why, take a look herewhere we explain why we love using this exchange.

For those who want to get on the exchange, here’s a step-by-step guide on how to!

Step 1: Go to Huobi.Pro https://www.huobi.br.com/zh-cn/register/?invite_code=xw923
For newcomers, do click on the link above to use the CryptoGrinder’s Huobi.Pro link!


Step 2: Sign Up For A New Account
The ‘Sign Up’ button can be found at the top right of the page, and will lead you to the following page.


To sign up, you will be required to provide a valid email, a password, and your nationality. Do note that once submitted, the nationality cannot be changed — ensure that the information is accurate to prevent any unnecessary issues with your account.

If you have friends in Huobi.Pro, do use their referral program! It costs you nothing, and your friends will really appreciate it. If not, please feel free to use this linkto sign up.


When you have entered in your details, simply type in the verification code in the box. This is to ensure that the website is not spammed by bots creating fake accounts.

Step 3: Check Your Email
After keying in the verification code, Huobi.Pro will inform you that a verification code has been sent to your email account.


Go to your email to find the code.


Simply type in the code, and you will be able to enter Huobi.Pro.

Step 4: Go Through The Tutorial
Unlike other exchanges, Huobi.Pro comes with a guided tour of the website. If you own no digital assets, click on the guide on the left. You will be guided on how to purchase digital assets using fiat, followed by a tutorial on how to use Huobi.Pro to exchange these digital assets into other cryptocurrencies of your choice.

For those that have digital assets, but not on Huobi.Pro, click on the guide on the right. You will skip the digital asset purchasing tutorial, and jump straight into how to best use the Huobi.Pro exchange.


Step 5: Verify Your Account
For those who are looking to move small amounts (0.1 BTC or less), there is not verification needed for Huobi.Pro. To trade larger amounts, you will be required to submit personal details for KYC checks.


You will need to fill in the necessary fields (Name and Passport number) as well as upload a photograph of your passport. After submitting your details, it will take them less than a week to verify you, and your account will be fully set up.

Step 6: Secure Your Account
Huobi.Pro is an exchange that holds a lot of money. While they have not been hacked in the last 5 years, it is always prudent to secure your account as much as possible, in case your device gets compromised.

Click on your username (top right of the screen) to open up the following options. Click on ‘Account and Security’.


There are 2 extra layers of security that can be added to your account: your phone number and your Google Authenticator.




For Google Authenticator, you can download the Authenticator Application from both the Apple and Play Store. However, bear in mind that the application is device specific: if you lose/damage the device, the authenticator will not be transferred to your new device.

To have an authenticator that is linked to your account, we recommend using Authy instead. Do keep your authenticator on a spare device, such as an iPad or Tablet, just in case.

Conclusion
With all that done, you’re ready to be a Huobi.Pro user!
